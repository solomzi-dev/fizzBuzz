# fizzBuzz
Problem statement:
Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

The algorithm for solving the FizzBuzz exercise (Pseudocode):
1. Grab the number from the user.
2. Loop from 1 to the entered number
3. If current number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz"
4. If current number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
5. If current number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz"
6. Otherwise print the current number
